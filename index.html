                    <p>From an early age, I noticed a strong inclination towards technology in myself.
                    I often found myself in situations where people would ask me: 'Did you see the new device that 
                    was launched?' These innovations fascinated me. I was eager to know how they worked, what was 
                    behind them—wait, computers have a language? Hold on, several? My interest was always focused 
                    on what was behind it all. I even started formatting relatives' phones, and that was my small 
                    beginning.<br><br>In 2013, my mother enrolled me in a computer and typing course, where I stood out. 
                    I even finished the course before the colleagues who had already been attending. However, despite
                    completing the course, a management change in the company prevented me from receiving my 
                    certificate, and that discouraged me.<br><br>I completed my elementary education at Escola Estadual 
                    Israel de Amorim, and in 9th grade, a professor from a Federal Institute invited us to take the 
                    entrance exam for an integrated high school program with one of three available courses: Systems 
                    Development, Chemistry, and Agriculture. Although I had never been a top student academically, 
                    I always loved challenges, as they motivated me to do my best. To my surprise, I was accepted 
                    and completed my high school with a technical degree in Systems Development, which broadened 
                    my view of new opportunities and ambitions.<br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in 
                    Computer Science, with the prospect of enrolling in a new course or a graduate program. My 
                    journey at a Federal Institute has provided me with enriching experiences, such as trips I 
                    wouldn’t have had outside the academic environment, and has motivated me to always seek new 
                    opportunities and fully dedicate myself to what I truly want.</p>
